         * from here on out, i have all the data from a CSV loaded into memory. I should now combine as much data as possible.
         * I'll do this by reading each EAN or other identifier, checking a running list of what EANS we've seen so far
         * If it's a match, i'll increase a count by 1. 
         * Maybe using a dictionary. Adding a new key every time i see a new identifier.
         * Where the value is the amount of times it's been seen.
         * 
         * The result will be a dictionary that's potentially many thousands lines long, that contains the identifier and the times it's shown up.
         * i'll use that data to find the combined cost to use in my final output.
         * When i have a list of all the unique products, i'll do another loop over each "type". So all types of the same clothing will be sorted the same.
         * to make this happen, i'll make a list of all the potential categories it could be,
         * and when looping over the unique products, i'll add the EAN to the category it fits in.
         * 
         * To make that happen, i'll need a "Category" column in the CSV, or i'll find it out based on the size.
         * Using the size would mean i would re-use what i've written, but change it to serve a different purpose. 
         * When i have a list of all the products in the category, i'll sort them within each category. 
         * Then pass the list of those items along to the next step, where it will combine the size, amount, costs ect. 
         * Then write it to a new CSV or Json
         * And that's the end of the program, for now.
